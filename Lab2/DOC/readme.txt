This VHDL module implements a synchronous digital system composed of two counters (fast and slow) and a combinational control unit. The design is parameterized by the generic constant n , which defines the bit-width of the counters and input signals. 

Inputs:
clk_i: Clock signal
rst_i: Synchronous reset
repeat_i: Enables repeating when the upper bound is reached
upperBound_i: Upper limit for the slow counter
Outputs:
count_o: Current value of the fast counter
busy_o: Indicates if the system is actively counting

The system operations:
The fast counter (fast_c) increments until it equals the slow counter (slow_c).
When fast_c = slow_c, fast_c resets and slow_c increments.
When slow_c reaches upperBound_i, the system either:
Repeats (resets both counters) if repeat_i = '1'
Stops (holds counters, sets busy_o = '0') if repeat_i = '0'"000" when fast_c = slow_c and slow_c < upperBound_i - will clear fast counter and +1 for slow counter

Control Logic Summary-
"000" when fast_c = slow_c and slow_c < upperBound_i - 	Reset fast_c, increment slow_c
"001" when fast_c < slow_c  - +1 fast counter
"010" when  slow_c = upperBound_i and repeat_i = '1'- do repeat and reset counters
"011" when  slow_c = upperBound_i and repeat_i = '0' - no repeat and busy off
"100" when  slow_c > upperBound_i and repeat_i = '1' - reset both counters
"101" when  slow_c > upperBound_i and repeat_i = '0' - no repeat and busy off
